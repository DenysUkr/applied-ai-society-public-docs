## AI Skills for Chapter Leaders (Coming Soon)

We are building open-source AI skills (starting with Claude Code) that make organizing events dramatically easier. Each skill wraps the playbooks that already exist in this repo. Event description writers, speaker outreach drafters, flyer generators, recap writers, sponsor pitch drafters. All open source, all improving as chapters use them.

```

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start       # Dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build   # Production build (runs prebuild checks)
```

## Adding New Documentation

1. Create your `.md` or `.mdx` file in the appropriate `docs/` subdirectory
2. Add YAML frontmatter with at minimum `sidebar_position` and `title`
3. **Register it in `sidebars.ts`**. New docs do NOT auto-appear in navigation. The prebuild check will warn about missing entries during `npm run build`
4. Follow brand rules: warm and human tone, no em dashes, no hype

## Brand Rules

- **Colors**: Orange `#E67B35`, Gold `#FFC14D`, Cream `#FAF7F1`, Olive `#5B6E4D`, Dark `#1A1A1A`
- **Tone**: Warm, human, practical. Not corporate, not hype.
- **No em dashes.** Use colons, parentheses, or separate sentences instead.
- **Illustrations**: Reuse existing assets in `static/img/illustrations/` before generating new ones. Use `nano-banana-pro` with `static/img/retro-ad-2026.png` as style reference for new illustrations.

Full brand guide: [docs/brand](https://docs.appliedaisociety.org/docs/brand)

## Asset CDN

Other AAS repos (slides, Remotion, portal) reference brand assets via `https://docs.appliedaisociety.org/img/` URLs. All files in `static/img/` are served at these paths. Do not move or rename assets without checking cross-repo references.

## Prebuild Scripts

Two scripts run automatically before every build:

1. **`scripts/generate-recent-updates.sh`**: Reads `git log` to find the 4 most recently created/modified docs. Writes `src/data/recentUpdates.json` for the homepage.
2. **`scripts/check-sidebar.sh`**: Warns about any `.md`/`.mdx` files not referenced in `sidebars.ts`.

## Contributing

This is an open-source project. If you are an AAS chapter leader, practitioner, or community member and you want to contribute:

1. Read the existing playbook for the area you want to improve
2. Fork this repo
3. Make your changes following the brand rules and doc structure above
4. Submit a PR
