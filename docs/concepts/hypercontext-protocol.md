# Hypercontext Protocol

*Your personal agent OS is your API to the world.*

---

## The Problem

Not every collaboration needs a [shared agentic project OS](/docs/concepts/lossy-ai-telephone). That pattern works for serious projects with dedicated teams. But most of your interactions are lighter than that: a potential client asking about your availability, a collaborator checking your current priorities, a friend's agent booking dinner for both of you.

Right now, these interactions still happen through [lossy AI telephone](/docs/concepts/lossy-ai-telephone). Someone emails you. You ask your AI to draft a response. They paste your response into their AI. Context degrades at every hop.

The underlying issue: there is no standardized way for trusted people (and their agents) to interact with your personal context directly.

## The Insight

Your [Personal Agentic OS](/docs/concepts/personal-agentic-os) already contains the truth about you: your schedule, your priorities, your preferences, your strategic documents, your relationship context. It produces the artifacts other people consume, whether that is turning markdown files into a Google Doc to share, drafting an email, or generating a brief.

Your command center is already your interface to the world. It just does not have a front door that other people's agents can knock on.

## People as APIs

The Hypercontext Protocol is the idea that every person (and eventually every organization) will run a personal API, powered by their agent OS, that trusted parties can query directly.

Think of it as an MCP server for your life. Your agent OS exposes specific context to specific people based on permissions you define. Instead of someone emailing you to ask when you are free next week, their agent queries your availability endpoint. Instead of a collaborator pasting your last update into ChatGPT to summarize it, their agent reads your project status directly from the source.

The name echoes "hypertext," which transformed static text into an interconnected web. Hypercontext transforms isolated personal knowledge into an interconnected web of shared, permissioned, high-fidelity context between trusted parties.

## How It Works (Simply)

**Your context lake.** Everything your Personal Agentic OS knows about you: documents, relationships, schedule, preferences, strategic priorities. This already exists if you have built a [command center](/docs/concepts/personal-agentic-os).

**Your permission surface.** Rules about who can access what. Your business partner sees your project status and availability. A potential client sees your portfolio and booking link. A stranger sees nothing. This is the same [permission surface](/docs/concepts/the-permission-surface) concept applied to human-to-human agent interactions.

**The query layer.** Other people's agents make requests in natural language: "What is Gary's availability next Tuesday?" or "What is the current status of the project we are working on together?" Your agent evaluates the request against your permissions and responds with exactly what is needed. Nothing more.

**The audit trail.** Every query and response is logged. You can review what context was shared, with whom, and when. Full transparency.

That is the protocol. Context lake, permission surface, query layer, audit trail. Everything else is implementation detail.

## Why This Matters

**Eliminates telephone.** When trusted agents query your context directly, there is no lossy compression. The truth travels intact from your system to theirs.

**Preserves sovereignty.** Your data never leaves your control. Agents query it in place. You decide what is visible and to whom. This is the opposite of platforms that collect your data on their servers.

**Scales trust.** You cannot personally respond to every inquiry. But your agent can, using your actual context, following your actual rules, 24/7. Your Personal Agentic OS becomes your always-on representative.

**Makes AI collaboration real.** The agentic internet is not agents talking to servers. It is agents talking to agents, on behalf of the humans they represent. The Hypercontext Protocol is the handshake that makes this possible without anyone surrendering their data.

## The Progression

This builds naturally on what already exists:

1. **[Personal Agentic OS](/docs/concepts/personal-agentic-os):** your agent OS, your command center (you are here)
2. **[Agentic Project OS](/docs/concepts/lossy-ai-telephone):** shared context for teams working on the same project
3. **Hypercontext Protocol:** your Personal Agentic OS as an API that trusted external agents can query (where this is going)

Today, MCP servers already enable tool-level interoperability between agents. The Hypercontext Protocol extends this to context-level interoperability between people. Your agent does not just use tools. It represents you to other people's agents, sharing exactly the context they need and nothing they don't.

## A Design Pattern, Not a Product

This is a design pattern that many people and organizations should implement as they build more sophisticated personal agent systems. The formalization will come. The infrastructure will come. What matters now is understanding the direction: **every person becomes an API, every interaction becomes a permissioned context exchange, and the lossy telephone game ends forever.**
