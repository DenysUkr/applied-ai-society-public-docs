# Flow-State Infra

*Every friction point is a feature request. The ideal worker of the future is constantly in flow state, and they build the infrastructure to stay there.*

---

## The Idea

The best applied AI practitioners share a habit: when something breaks their focus, they don't just push through it. They build something that eliminates the friction permanently.

This is flow-state infra. It is the practice of treating every interruption, every repeated conversation, every manual process, and every moment of "I wish this existed" as a signal. Not a complaint. A spec.

The worker of the future does not tolerate friction. They resolve it. And because AI-assisted development has collapsed the cost of building custom tools to near zero, there is no longer a reason to live with problems that can be solved in an afternoon.

## Why This Matters Now

Before AI-assisted coding, building a custom tool to solve a personal workflow problem was expensive. You needed to be a developer, or hire one, or find a product that was close enough. Most friction just stayed friction.

That constraint is gone. With a [Personal Jarvis](/docs/concepts/personal-jarvis) and a coding harness (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.), anyone who can describe their problem clearly can build a solution. The loop is now:

1. Notice friction
2. Describe what you wish existed
3. Build it (with AI doing the heavy lifting)
4. Use it immediately
5. Iterate from real usage

This loop can complete in minutes. An afternoon of focused building can produce tools you use every day for years.

## The "I Wish" Protocol

The simplest version of flow-state infra is a habit: whenever you catch yourself thinking "I wish..." or "this is annoying" or "why do I have to do this every time," you write it down.

That note becomes a spec. The spec becomes a tool. The tool eliminates the friction.

A more structured version: keep an "I Wish" command in your Jarvis or AI workspace. When you invoke it, it walks you through:

1. **What is the friction?** Describe the problem in plain language.
2. **How often does it happen?** Daily? Weekly? Every time you do X?
3. **What would the ideal solution look like?** Not the implementation. The experience.
4. **Where should it live?** Your personal site? A CLI tool? A browser extension? A page in an existing app?
5. **What is the simplest version that solves 80% of the problem?**

Then you build it. Right then. While the frustration is fresh and the motivation is high. Your AI coding harness handles the implementation. You handle the intent.

## Case Study: Gary Sheng's Personal Site as Flow-State Infra

Gary Sheng's personal website ([garysheng.com](https://garysheng.com)) started as a standard personal site. Over time, it has become a living platform where every repeated friction point gets resolved with a new page or tool. The site is password-protected where needed, publicly accessible where useful, and continuously evolving.

Here are three examples of flow-state infra built in single sessions:

### The "Why Austin" Problem

Gary kept having the same conversation: "Why did you move to Austin?" Every coffee chat, every new connection, the same question. Instead of writing a blog post (static, formal, feels like a one-time thing), he vibe-coded a continuously updated wiki page at `/why-austin`. Now when the question comes up, he sends a link. The conversation can go deeper instead of repeating the basics.

**Friction:** Repeating the same explanation dozens of times.
**Solution:** A living page that answers the question once, updated as his thinking evolves.
**Build time:** One session.

### The "Go Deeper" Problem

People would visit Gary's personal site and want to know more. "This is cool, but what are you actually about?" Instead of cramming everything onto the homepage, he built a `/deeper` page: a single link for anyone who wants the full picture.

**Friction:** No good answer to "tell me more" that wasn't a 30-minute conversation.
**Solution:** A curated deep-dive page, one link to share.
**Build time:** One session.

### The Flow Notes Problem

During video calls, Gary would have thoughts he didn't want to lose but also didn't want to interrupt the conversation to capture. He needed a way to jot notes in real time, track which topic was active, mark threads as done, and review how the conversation flowed afterward.

He described the problem to his AI coding harness and built Flow Notes: a real-time note-taking tool with an active focus tracker, masonry grid of thought tiles, session timer, and shareable session links. It syncs between phone and laptop via Firebase, so he can thumb-type on his phone while the call runs on his laptop.

**Friction:** Losing thoughts during conversations, or interrupting the flow to capture them.
**Solution:** A purpose-built tool for in-conversation note-taking with topic tracking.
**Build time:** One session. From brainstorm interview to working, deployed product.

### The Pattern

All three share the same structure:

1. A real problem that kept recurring
2. No existing product that solved it the right way
3. A solution built in hours, not weeks
4. Bolted onto an existing platform (the personal site) rather than spun up as a separate project
5. Immediately useful, iterable from real usage

The personal website becomes a default home for flow-state infra. It is already deployed, already authenticated, already yours. Adding a new tool is just adding a new route. Think of it less like a portfolio and more like a personal operating system with a web interface.

## Building Your Own Flow-State Infra

You do not need to be a professional developer. You need:

1. **A deployed personal site or app.** This is your home base. Next.js on Vercel is the default recommendation because it is free to start, deploys in seconds, and supports both static pages and dynamic tools.

2. **A coding harness.** Claude Code, Cursor, or any AI-assisted development environment. This is what turns your description of a problem into working code.

3. **The "I Wish" habit.** Start noticing friction. Write it down. Build from it.

4. **A bias toward action.** The cost of building is so low that the main bottleneck is deciding to start. If you can describe the problem, you can build the solution. Today. Not next quarter.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

- **[Personal Jarvis](/docs/concepts/personal-jarvis):** Your Jarvis is the context layer. Flow-state infra is what you build when that context reveals friction.
- **[Harness Engineering](/docs/concepts/harness-engineering):** The coding harness is the tool that makes flow-state infra possible at low cost.
- **[Liberation Architecture](/docs/concepts/liberation-architecture):** Flow-state infra liberates trapped time and attention, the same way liberation architecture liberates trapped business value.
- **[The Tinkerer's Curse](/docs/concepts/the-tinkerers-curse):** Be aware of over-building. Flow-state infra should solve real, recurring problems. Building a tool you use once is not flow-state infra. It is procrastination.
- **[Permissionless Knowledge](/docs/concepts/permissionless-knowledge):** Flow-state infra applied to the problem of scaling expertise. Courses, docs, and automated systems that serve people without requiring your presence.
- **[Context Overflow](/docs/concepts/context-overflow):** The problem that arises when your signal attracts more demand than you can handle. Flow-state infra is one of the tools for managing it.

*The best tool is the one you build the moment you realize you need it.*
